# Getting Started

Make sure you have `vagrant` installed. For instance, on OS X with Homebrew:

```
$ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
$ brew cask install vagrant
```

Then, ensure you have the appropriate Vagrant Box installed:

```
$ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty32
```

You can get started with development by running the `Vagrantfile`:

```
$ vagrant up
```

This will provision an entire setup for you pretty quickly (see `provision/dev/bootstrap.sh`). You can access Django and start `runserver` by doing the following:

```
$ vagrant ssh
$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

You can then access the site from your web browser by going to http://192.168.19.61:8000/

To suspend Vagrant
```
vagrant suspend
```
